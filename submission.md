TAP 2024 accepts papers of two kinds:

**Regular papers:** full submissions describing

- original research results,
- tools, and
- case studies

of up to 16 pages. For tools and case studies, the tool, framework, or
case study described in a tool paper should be available for public use.

**Short papers:** submissions describing preliminary findings, proofs of
concepts, and exploratory studies, of up to 6 pages.

All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included,
but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion.

Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted
for publication elsewhere.
Papers
have to adhere to Springer’s LNCS format and must be submitted in PDF
format at the EasyChair submission site:

### Review Process

Papers will undergo a thorough review process. The review process is
single blind. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance,
relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The submissions will
be reviewed and selected for publication based on the above-mentioned
criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s technical program.

### Artifact Evaluation

After notification, all artifacts of accepted papers will be reviewed
with respect to their availability, consistency with and replicability
of results in the paper, completeness, documentation, and ease of use.
The papers with publicly available artifacts will receive 
corresponding badges.

### Proceedings

Accepted submissions will be published in Springer’s LNCS series.
