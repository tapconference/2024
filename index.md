## Scope

TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP
promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the
interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate
goal of improving software and system dependability.

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous
techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of
dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic
techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are
complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that
provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and
dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic
execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or
the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration.
The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel 
combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property 
verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing. 

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,
including foundational work, tool development, and empirical
research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static
techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.
