TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP
promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the
interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate
goal of improving software and system dependability.

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous
techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of
dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic
techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are
complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Dynamic analysis
typically offers cost-effective debugging techniques of
specifications or crucial parts of program proofs (such as
invariants) and is indispensable when it comes to the validation of
the underlying assumptions of complex system models involving
hardware and/or system environments. Static analysis provides strong
guarantees, but typically requires more effort (which can be reduced
by exploiting dynamic analysis results). Notable examples that
provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and
dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic
execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or
the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration.
The verification of ML-based systems spurs novel combinations of
dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate
models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology,
including foundational work, tool development, and empirical
research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static
techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests,
- Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques,
- Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of
test vectors and oracles,
- Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of
coverage criteria,
- Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
- Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
- Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
- Testing and Verification of ML-based systems,
- Verification of verification tools and environments,
- Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,
- Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of
formal certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …), and
- Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and
experience reports

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors are encouraged (but not required) to make the relevant
artifacts available to the reviewers (and whenever possible
publicly). Artifacts can be provided at submission time or after
notification of acceptance.
